  content: "Dear Diary, \n\r\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about what\u2019s ahead.
    It\u2019s hard to even wrap my head around it. My body feels worn down and the
    air is already thinning. I don\u2019t know.. But the closer I get, the more it
    feels like I\u2019m not meant to make it. I keep thinking about last year. It\u2019s
    my fault that we nearly both died. But Phillip keeps me going. He\u2019s always
    there when I need him. I don\u2019t know how I would do this without him. I keep
    telling myself that I have to finish the climb for him. For us. But as the cold
    creeps in, I start to wonder\u2026 am I doing this for him? Or am I doing this
    for me? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s waiting for me at the top but I\u2019m
    afraid I won\u2019t even make it past this last stretch. But then I remember
    why I\u2019m here. Why I am pushing myself. Phillip has been with me every step
    of the way. I can\u2019t let him down now. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll climb.\r\r \r\r\n"
