  content: "Dear Diary, \nBase Camp feels less like a starting point and more like
    a strange home. The cold\u2019s always there, but I\u2019m getting used to it.
    The sounds of people prepping and the constant hum of activity are almost...
    comforting. But every time I look up at Everest, it hits me\u2026 This is happening.
    I\u2019m really doing this. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready, but I\u2019ve
    come this far. Just one foot in front of the other, right?\n\n- Alice\n"
