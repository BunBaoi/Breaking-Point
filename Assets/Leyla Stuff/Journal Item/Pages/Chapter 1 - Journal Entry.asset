  pageTitle: Mount Everest - Base Camp
  content: "Dear Diary,\n\nWe finally made it. Base Camp. After months of training,
    planning, and second guessing, we\u2019re finally here. Standing at the base
    of the tallest mountain in the world, staring up at the impossible. It doesn\u2019t
    feel real yet. The air is thin, but I can still hear Phillip\u2019s excitement,
    see the way his eyes light up at the peaks above us. He keeps joking that I\u2019m
    taking this too seriously, that I\u2019m too focused. But how can I not be? We\u2019ve
    dreamt about this for years and now\u2026 and now it\u2019s a reality for both
    of us together. Together. I should be happy but there\u2019s this feeling that
    I just can\u2019t get rid of. Maybe it\u2019s just nerves or the altitude is
    getting to me already. Phillip says I\u2019m overthinking, that we should enjoy
    the moment. And maybe he\u2019s right. Tomorrow we take our first steps towards
    a dream. Towards conquering another mountain. That we belong up here. We promised
    each other we would reach the top together. I won\u2019t let us break that promise
    now.\n\n- Alice\n"
